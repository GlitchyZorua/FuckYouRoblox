# Why?
Roblox has abused kids. Simple as that. This is a list of all of the sites owned by roblox, and some unofficial roblox games that have its own website, wiki, or whatever.

If you are a parent, guardian, school, daycare, or whatever, that knows alot about managing networks, and has a kid/student who's been abused by Roblox predators, **this list is for you**.
