# Why?
Roblox has abused kids. Simple as that. This is a list of all of the sites owned by roblox, and some unofficial roblox games that have its own website, wiki, or whatever.

If you are a parent, guardian, school, daycare, or whatever, that knows alot about managing networks, and has a kid/student who's been abused by Roblox predators, **this list is for you**. 

## If you are Roblox, Roblox Staff, CEO of Roblox, looking at this github repository, *fuck off.*
## If you are a Roblox Developer upset, because your games website, is listed on here.
Stop fucking around. It is **your** fault for not using an actual game engine, Like Unity, or Godot.

**Why is this is a big issue?** 
Simply because, all of the games you made on roblox, is all locked on to that awful platform. You won't get ***anything*** return, other then useless paper money known as Robux. Nothing is more important then real world money, so you can buy some  food and water. your game is gonna be in this ticking time bomb until roblox decides to shut everything down. due to the endless. amount. of. lawsuits. that are. coming. over. to. roblox, we don't know when that day will happen.

That being said, If you want to compile your roblox game over to something like, unity or godot or whatever, so you can upload your game, to somewhere else like Steam or itch.io, you can do that. Roblox games uses C++, so its definitely doable [just like what unturned dev did](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/r2g3h8/the_time_roblox_caused_the_unturned_developer_to/).
